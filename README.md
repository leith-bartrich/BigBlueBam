## The Vision

Most work platforms are built for humans talking to humans. BigBlueBam is built for **human-AI collaboration**, a world where your team and AI agents plan projects, message each other, close deals, write docs, track goals, automate workflows, and support customers in the same suite, at the same time.

**Humans** own the strategy: setting priorities, defining epics, closing deals, reviewing deliverables, talking to customers.

**AI agents** own the routine: triaging helpdesk tickets, writing knowledge base articles, drafting documents, updating CRM pipelines, generating sprint reports, firing workflow automations, and keeping the board organized.

The **suite** is the shared workspace. When an AI agent creates a task, replies to a customer, updates a deal, or posts to a Banter channel, it shows up in real time, right alongside everything your team is doing. No separate dashboards. No hidden automation. Full transparency.

This is made possible by **215 MCP tools** that give AI assistants (Claude, Claude Code, custom agents) full read-write access to project boards, sprints, team messaging, helpdesk tickets, knowledge base, collaborative docs, workflow automations, goals and OKRs, whiteboards, CRM pipelines, email campaigns, analytics dashboards, and more.

## For Teams

### Kanban Board

Drag-and-drop cards across 5 configurable phases with WIP limits. Each card shows priority, assignee, story points, due date, and comment count at a glance. Motion spring physics make the interactions feel natural.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/03-board.png" alt="Kanban Board — Dark Mode" width="100%" />
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Dark mode — the default for late-night deploys.</em></p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/13-board-light.png" alt="Kanban Board — Light Mode" width="100%" />
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Light mode — because some people like the sun.</em></p>

### Swimlanes

Group tasks by assignee, priority, or epic. Collapsible rows show task count and total story points per group, making it easy to spot bottlenecks and unbalanced workloads.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/05-swimlanes.png" alt="Swimlanes by Assignee" width="100%" />
</p>

### Five Views, One Board

Every project supports five views — switch between them without losing your filters or context:

| View | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Board** | Kanban columns with drag-and-drop cards |
| **List** | Sortable, filterable table with inline editing |
| **Timeline** | Gantt-style horizontal bars from start to due date |
| **Calendar** | Monthly calendar with tasks on their due dates |
| **Workload** | Team member capacity and allocation |

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/06-list-view.png" alt="List View" width="100%" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/07-timeline.png" alt="Timeline View" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><em>List view with sortable columns</em></td>
    <td align="center"><em>Timeline / Gantt view with today marker</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/08-calendar.png" alt="Calendar View" width="100%" />
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Calendar view — monthly navigation with task due dates</em></p>

### Task Detail

Click any card to open the detail drawer. Full rich-text description with image support, assignee, priority, phase, sprint, story points, start and due dates, subtasks, file attachments, comments with emoji reactions, and a complete activity feed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/04-task-detail.png" alt="Task Detail Drawer" width="100%" />
</p>

### Sprint Management

Create sprints, assign tasks, track velocity. When a sprint ends, the carry-forward ceremony moves incomplete work to the next sprint automatically. Sprint reports show burndown, velocity trends, and completion rates.

### Project Dashboard

Charts and widgets for sprint progress, priority breakdown, overdue tasks, task distribution by phase, and team workload — all in one place.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/09-project-dashboard.png" alt="Project Analytics Dashboard" width="100%" />
</p>

### My Work

A cross-project view of everything assigned to you, grouped by project. One place to see your full plate.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/10-my-work.png" alt="My Work View" width="100%" />
</p>

### Command Palette

Press **Ctrl+K** to open the command palette. Search tasks, switch projects, navigate views, and trigger actions without touching the mouse.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/14-command-palette.png" alt="Command Palette" width="100%" />
</p>

### Organization Management

BigBlueBam ships a dedicated **People** surface (not buried under Settings) that covers the full identity lifecycle — invite, edit, assign, disable — with strict role-based gating.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/people-list.png" alt="People list — searchable, filterable, bulk-selectable" width="100%" />
</p>

Filter by role or status, search by name or email, and act on individual members or in bulk.

#### Per-user detail, four tabs

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-detail-overview.png" alt="Overview tab" width="100%" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-detail-projects.png" alt="Projects tab" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><em>Overview — identity, membership, disable toggle</em></td>
    <td align="center"><em>Projects — per-project roles, bulk assign</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-detail-access.png" alt="Access tab" width="100%" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-detail-activity.png" alt="Activity tab" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><em>Access — API keys, password reset, force change</em></td>
    <td align="center"><em>Activity — per-user audit trail</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Admins can reset passwords (manual or auto-generated), mint API keys on behalf of users with scoped permissions, force a password change on next login, or sign the user out of every device.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-reset-password-dialog.png" alt="Reset password dialog" width="100%" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/people-create-api-key-dialog.png" alt="Create API key dialog" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><em>Reset password — auto-generate or set manually</em></td>
    <td align="center"><em>Create API key on behalf of a user (one-time token reveal)</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Bulk operations

Select multiple members to disable, enable, change role, remove from org, or export as CSV — all with rank-gating that mirrors the server:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/people-bulk-toolbar.png" alt="Bulk actions toolbar" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Multi-org membership

Users can belong to multiple organizations. The header shows the current org + role, and the org switcher lets multi-org users hop between them in one click — the session rotates and every query is invalidated, so the rest of the app instantly reflects the new org's data.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/org-switcher.png" alt="Org switcher dropdown" width="75%" />
</p>

A persistent banner warns when an org has no active owner, so operators can promote a replacement before the situation becomes invisible:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/no-owner-banner.png" alt="No active owner banner" width="100%" />
</p>

#### SuperUser console

A separate SuperUser namespace at `/b3/superuser` gives platform operators cross-org visibility without impersonation. See every org on the server, context-switch into any of them, and manage users globally.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/superuser-overview.png" alt="SuperUser console overview" width="100%" />
</p>

**Cross-org user management** — one view of every user regardless of org:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/superuser-people-list.png" alt="SuperUser cross-org people list" width="100%" />
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/superuser-people-memberships.png" alt="All memberships" width="100%" /></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="images/superuser-people-sessions.png" alt="Active sessions" width="100%" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><em>Every org the user belongs to — add, remove, change role, set default</em></td>
    <td align="center"><em>Every active session with IP, device, and revoke controls</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/superuser-people-activity.png" alt="SuperUser audit log for a user" width="100%" />
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Audit log — every SuperUser action against this user with expandable details</em></p>

When a SuperUser is context-switched into a non-native org, a red banner and chip in the header make the privileged state impossible to miss:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/superuser-context-banner.png" alt="SuperUser context banner" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Forced password change

Admins can flag a user to require a password change on their next login. On sign-in, the user is bounced to a dedicated form that blocks every other page until a new password is set:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/password-change.png" alt="Forced password change page" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Theme-aware UI

Every screen adapts to light and dark mode. Most of the shots in this README are dark; here's the same People list in light mode:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/people-list-light.png" alt="People list — light mode" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Integrations

Configure calendar feeds, API keys, and webhooks under Settings:

## For AI Agents

BigBlueBam exposes **215 MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools** that give AI assistants full access to your project management workflow, team messaging, customer support, knowledge base, collaborative documents, workflow automations, goals & OKRs, visual collaboration whiteboards, and CRM pipeline management. Connect Claude, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible agent and let it work alongside your team.

### What AI Agents Can Do

- **Create and manage tasks** — create tasks, set priority and assignee, move cards across phases, add subtasks
- **Run sprints** — create sprints, assign tasks, start/complete sprints, generate sprint reports
- **Triage helpdesk tickets** — when a customer submits a ticket, a task is auto-created; AI agents can then triage by adjusting priority, setting timelines, assigning to the right engineer, rejecting out-of-scope requests, and posting responses to customers
- **Generate reports** — velocity reports, burndown charts, cumulative flow, workload distribution, overdue task alerts
- **Collaborate** — post comments, log time, bulk update tasks, suggest branch names
- **Message the team via Banter** — post messages, read channels, respond in threads, share task updates, manage channels, react to messages, search conversations, and participate in voice calls as spoken participants
- **Manage the knowledge base via Beacon** — create and publish Beacons, search with semantic + graph retrieval, verify content freshness, link related knowledge, manage governance policies, and save reusable queries
- **Author collaborative documents via Brief** — create, edit, and search documents, manage version history, leave inline comments, apply templates, and graduate finished documents into Beacons
- **Automate workflows with Bolt** — create trigger-condition-action rules, manage executions, browse templates, and orchestrate cross-product automations that compile to MCP tool calls
- **Track goals & OKRs with Bearing** — create time-boxed periods, define goals with key results, link KRs to Bam tasks for automatic progress, post status updates, and generate at-risk reports
- **Collaborate visually on Board** — create and manage whiteboard rooms, add and arrange shapes, read canvas content for AI analysis, manage participants, embed cross-product content, and run sticky-to-task pipelines
- **Manage CRM pipeline with Bond** — create and update contacts, companies, and deals, advance deals through pipeline stages, log activities, search the contact database, and generate pipeline reports

### Example: AI-Powered Helpdesk Triage

> A customer submits a bug report through the helpdesk portal. BigBlueBam automatically creates a `FRND-` prefixed task on the board. An AI agent picks up the new task, analyzes the description, sets priority to High, assigns it to the right engineer based on the related epic, adjusts the timeline, and posts a response to the customer: *"Thanks for reporting this — we've assigned task FRND-247 to the team and it's been prioritized. We'll update you when there's a fix."*
>
> The engineer sees the triaged card on their board. The customer sees the response in their portal. The task was created automatically; the AI handled the triage.

### Example: AI Gathering Details from Vague Reports

> A customer submits a ticket: *"The app isn't working."* BigBlueBam auto-creates a task, and an AI agent picks it up. Recognizing the report lacks actionable detail, the agent responds to the customer through the helpdesk portal:
>
> *"Sorry to hear that! To help us investigate, could you provide a few details?*
> - *What were you trying to do when the issue occurred?*
> - *What device and browser are you using? (e.g., iPhone 14 / Safari, Windows / Chrome)*
> - *Does the issue happen every time or intermittently?*
> - *If possible, a screenshot of any error message would be very helpful."*
>
> The agent sets the task to `waiting_on_customer` and adds an internal note for the engineering team: *"Vague report — asked customer for repro steps, device info, and screenshots. Will re-triage once details come in."* When the customer replies with specifics, the agent updates the task description, sets the appropriate priority, and assigns it to the right engineer — all before a human touches it.

## AI Provider Configuration

BigBlueBam features a hierarchical LLM provider configuration system that powers AI features across the suite — including Bolt's AI-assisted automation authoring, future summarization, and content generation features.

### How It Works

Providers are configured at three levels, with the most specific taking precedence:

| Scope | Who Configures | Applies To |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **System** | SuperUser | All organizations (fallback default) |
| **Organization** | Org Admin/Owner | All projects in the org |
| **Project** | Project Admin | Only that project |

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | `anthropic` | Claude models. Uses default API endpoint. |
| **OpenAI** | `openai` | GPT models. Uses default API endpoint. |
| **OpenAI-Compatible** | `openai_compatible` | Any endpoint implementing the OpenAI Chat Completions API — Azure OpenAI, Together AI, Ollama, vLLM, local LLMs, etc. Requires custom `api_endpoint`. |

### Security

- API keys are **encrypted at rest** using AES-256-GCM with the server's `SESSION_SECRET`
- Keys are **never returned in full** — always redacted to `sk-•••XXXX` (last 4 characters only)
- Scope-based authorization ensures only the right roles can configure each level
- Test Connection verifies credentials work before saving

### Setup

Configure providers in **Settings → AI Providers** in the Bam frontend. If no provider is configured, AI-dependent features (like Bolt's "Describe your automation" dialog) show a helpful message directing admins to the setup page.

---

## Quick Start

> **📖 Full deployment guide:** [docs/deployment-guide.md](docs/deployment-guide.md) — step-by-step walkthrough with interactive setup wizard, password generation, and platform selection (Docker Compose for self-hosted; Railway for managed cloud — both fully automated).

### Guided Setup (Recommended)

The interactive deploy script handles everything — installs dependencies, generates secrets, provisions infrastructure, and creates your admin account:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eoffermann/BigBlueBam.git
cd BigBlueBam

# Linux / macOS
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

### Manual Setup with Docker Compose

If you prefer to set things up manually:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eoffermann/BigBlueBam.git
cd BigBlueBam

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secrets (passwords, session secret)

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Create your admin account
docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js create-admin \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --password YourPassword123 \
  --name "Admin User" \
  --org "My Organization"
```

#### Provision the internal MCP service account

Bolt automations and the background worker invoke MCP tools over an internal HTTP path (`POST /mcp/tools/call`) instead of holding a persistent MCP session. That path is authenticated two ways: a shared secret (`INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET`, already generated by `cp .env.example .env` or the deploy script) plus a bearer token tied to a dedicated service-account user that `mcp-server` uses to talk to the rest of the stack on behalf of internal callers.

If `MCP_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` is blank in your `.env`, `mcp-server` still boots and external MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) work fine — but every call to `POST /mcp/tools/call` returns HTTP 503 with `INTERNAL_NOT_CONFIGURED`, which means **Bolt automations that invoke MCP tools will fail** and any worker job relying on the internal path won't be able to call MCP tools either. For a self-hosted single-operator setup you can leave it blank; for anything that needs Bolt-to-MCP integration, provision the token once:

```bash
# 1. Mint a service account + API key (prefix bbam_svc_). The --org-slug
#    is the one you created with create-admin above; slugify() lowercases
#    and hyphenates the --org value (e.g. "My Organization" becomes
#    "my-organization"). Run `docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js list-orgs`
#    if you're not sure.
docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js create-service-account \
  --name mcp-internal \
  --org-slug my-organization

# 2. The command prints a token once:
#       Token:      bbam_svc_abcdef0123456789...
#    Copy that value (not the command output around it) and paste it into .env:
#       MCP_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN=bbam_svc_abcdef0123456789...

# 3. Restart mcp-server so it picks up the new env var.
docker compose up -d --force-recreate mcp-server
```

You only need to do this once per stack. If you wipe the postgres volume you will need to re-mint the token because the service-account user lives in the database. The token is not rotated automatically; to rotate, mint a new service account with a different `--name`, swap the env var, restart, then delete the old service-account user via `docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js revoke-api-key --prefix bbam_svc`.
