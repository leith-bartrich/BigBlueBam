// Lightweight BullMQ producer for the shared `email` queue.
//
// The worker service (apps/worker) owns actual SMTP delivery via
// processEmailJob. The API only enqueues jobs here. Job shape must match
// apps/worker/src/jobs/email.job.ts → EmailJobData.
//
// We expose sendGuestInvitationEmail as the single caller for P1-30. The
// function returns `email_sent` = true only when the job was successfully
// enqueued AND SMTP is configured. When SMTP is unset, we still enqueue so
// the worker will log it, but we return email_sent = false so the API
// response accurately reflects that the invitee was not actually emailed.
