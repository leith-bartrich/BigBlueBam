// This package exists so Wave 4 CI work has a concrete target to wire up.
// It does NOT currently run against a live docker compose stack. Every
// service client used in src/tests/ is mocked in-process using a simple
// fetch-style stub so the smoke test can exercise the Bam -> Bond -> Bolt
// -> Beacon routing fan-out without any containers running.
//
// When Wave 4 flips the live-stack switch, point fixtures/stack.fixture.ts
// at a real compose file and let Vitest drive it sequentially.
