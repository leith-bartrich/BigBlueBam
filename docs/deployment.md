# Deployment Guide

BigBlueBam is Docker-native from day one. The architecture supports a progression from a single-machine Docker Compose deployment to a fully orchestrated Kubernetes cluster, with no application code changes required at any tier.

## Tier 1: Single Machine Docker Compose

The simplest deployment. Everything runs on one machine with `docker compose up`.

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4 cores |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| **Storage** | 20 GB SSD | 50 GB SSD |
| **Network** | 10 Mbps | 100 Mbps |

### Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/bigblueceiling/BigBlueBam.git
cd BigBlueBam
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secrets

# 2. Start the stack — the `migrate` service runs automatically
#    as a dependency of api / helpdesk-api / banter-api / worker
docker compose up -d

# 3. (Optional) Run migrations explicitly if you want to see the output
docker compose run --rm migrate

# 4. Create admin user
docker compose exec api node dist/cli.js create-admin \
  --email admin@yourcompany.com \
  --password your-secure-password \
  --name "Admin" \
  --org "Your Company"

# 5. Access at http://localhost (or your server IP)
```

### Resource Allocation

| Service | RAM | CPU |
|---|---|---|
| frontend | 128 MB | 0.25 |
| api | 512 MB | 1.0 |
| mcp-server | 256 MB | 0.5 |
| worker | 512 MB | 1.0 |
| postgres | 1 GB | 1.0 |
| redis | 256 MB | 0.25 |
| minio | 256 MB | 0.25 |
| **Total** | **~2.9 GB** | **~4.25** |

### TLS Configuration

The bundled nginx inside the `frontend` container serves plain HTTP on the configured `HTTP_PORT` only. It does **not** currently terminate TLS — `infra/nginx/nginx.conf` has no `listen 443 ssl;` block, and no certificate material is mounted into the container.

TLS is expected to terminate at an upstream layer:

- **Cloud:** a managed load balancer, CDN, or edge service (AWS ALB, Cloudflare, Fastly, Railway's edge, etc.)
- **Self-hosted:** a reverse proxy on the host or on another node (Caddy, host-level nginx, Traefik, Synology DSM reverse proxy, etc.)

Set `CORS_ORIGIN`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and `PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` to the `https://` public URL of whichever upstream terminates TLS — the deploy script populates these automatically from the domain you enter at setup. Configure the upstream to forward to your server's `HTTP_PORT` (default 80; configurable via the deploy script's **Host port exposure** prompt).

**Future HTTPS integration.** `docker-compose.ssl.yml` is an overlay that adds an HTTPS host port publish on the `frontend` service. The bundled nginx does not terminate TLS today, so opting in reserves the port but no TLS is served until TLS termination is added to nginx. The deploy script's Host port exposure prompt toggles this overlay.

---

## Forward-Only Migration Policy

BigBlueBam uses a **forward-only** schema migration model. This has direct consequences for any operator running the stack:

- **All schema lives in `infra/postgres/migrations/NNNN_*.sql`.** The legacy `infra/postgres/init.sql` has been removed; do not expect it to exist.
- **Migrations auto-apply on every deploy.** The `migrate` docker-compose service is a `service_completed_successfully` dependency of `api`, `helpdesk-api`, `banter-api`, and `worker`. App containers will not start until the database is at the current schema version.
- **Upgrades for existing clients are zero-touch.** Pull the new image, `docker compose up -d`, migrations run, services start. There is no manual SQL step.
- **Migrations are immutable once applied.** The runner records a SHA-256 checksum of each applied migration's SQL body. Editing a file after it has been applied to any environment causes the runner to abort with `CHECKSUM MISMATCH`. If you need to amend applied schema, **create a new migration file**.
- **No rollback tooling is provided.** There are no `down` scripts. Destructive changes (drop column, drop table, rename) must use the **expand-contract** pattern:
  1. Additive migration (new column / new table) — old and new code both work
  2. Deploy application code that writes to both places / reads from the new place
  3. Backfill migration
  4. Contract migration (drop old column / old table) in a later release, after all running app versions have been upgraded
- **Schema changes are additive by default.** A migration should be safe to apply while the previous application version is still serving traffic.
- **Fresh installs and existing deployments converge on the same list.** There is no "baseline" vs "upgrade" split — the migrations folder is the single source of truth.

### What this means for early clients

If you are running BigBlueBam from a pre-migration-system snapshot (i.e., your database was created from the old `init.sql`), the `0000_init.sql` and subsequent migrations are written to be idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.). On first run, the migrate service will record all historical migrations as applied without making destructive changes to your existing data.

Inspect what has been applied:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U bigbluebam -c \
  "SELECT id, applied_at FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY id;"
```

---

## WebSocket Proxy Requirements

BigBlueBam exposes three WebSocket endpoints through nginx:

| Path | Upstream | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/b3/ws` | `api:4000` | BBB realtime (tasks, boards, sprints) |
| `/banter/ws` | `banter-api:4002` | Banter realtime (channels, messages, calls) |
| `/helpdesk/ws` | `helpdesk-api:4001` | Helpdesk realtime (tickets, typing, presence) |

Any proxy layer in front of nginx (cloud load balancer, CDN, reverse proxy) **must**:

- Forward the `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: upgrade` headers unmodified
- Allow long-lived connections (set idle timeout to at least 60s, preferably 300s+)
- Not buffer the WebSocket stream (`proxy_buffering off` on nginx-style proxies)
- Route all three WS paths to the correct backend service

When scaling any of the API services horizontally, cross-instance broadcast is handled by **Redis PubSub** — sticky sessions are *not* required, but Redis must be reachable from every replica.

---

## Tier 2: Managed Data Layer

Replace self-hosted PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO with managed cloud services. Only environment variable changes required -- no code changes.

### Environment Variable Changes

```dotenv
# Replace PostgreSQL with managed service (AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, Neon, etc.)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@your-rds-instance.amazonaws.com:5432/bigbluebam?sslmode=require

# Replace Redis with managed service (ElastiCache, Upstash, etc.)
REDIS_URL=rediss://:password@your-redis.cache.amazonaws.com:6379

# Replace MinIO with S3 / R2 / GCS
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
S3_ACCESS_KEY=AKIA...
S3_SECRET_KEY=...
S3_BUCKET=bigbluebam-attachments
S3_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Docker Compose Changes

Remove the data service definitions from `docker-compose.yml` (or override with a `docker-compose.cloud.yml`):

```yaml
# docker-compose.cloud.yml
services:
  postgres:
    profiles: ["disabled"]
  redis:
    profiles: ["disabled"]
  minio:
    profiles: ["disabled"]
```

Run with: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.cloud.yml up -d`

### Benefits

- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- High availability and failover
- Managed patching and upgrades
- Monitoring and alerting built in

---

## Tier 3: Horizontal Scaling

Scale application containers behind a load balancer. Data services remain managed.

### Architecture

```mermaid

    end

    API2 --> Redis
    API3 --> Redis
    W1 --> Redis
    W2 --> Redis
    W1 --> PG
    W2 --> PG
```

### Load Balancer Configuration

WebSocket connections require sticky sessions or Redis PubSub for cross-instance broadcasting (already built in):

```nginx
# nginx load balancer example
upstream api_backend {
    least_conn;
    server api-1:4000;
    server api-2:4000;
    server api-3:4000;
}

upstream mcp_backend {
    least_conn;
    server mcp-1:3001;
    server mcp-2:3001;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    location /b3/api/ {
        proxy_pass http://api_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /b3/ws {
        proxy_pass http://api_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }

    location /helpdesk/api/ {
        proxy_pass http://helpdesk_api_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
    }

    location /helpdesk/ws {
        proxy_pass http://helpdesk_api_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }

    location /mcp/ {
        proxy_pass http://mcp_backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
    }

    location /b3/ {
        alias /usr/share/nginx/html/b3/;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /b3/index.html;
    }

    location /helpdesk/ {
        alias /usr/share/nginx/html/helpdesk/;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /helpdesk/index.html;
    }

    location = / {
        return 302 /helpdesk/;
    }
}
```

### Scaling with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d --scale api=3 --scale worker=2 --scale mcp-server=2
```

### Key Considerations

- **WebSocket scaling**: Redis PubSub ensures events reach all connected clients regardless of which API instance they are connected to.
- **BullMQ scaling**: Worker instances coordinate via Redis. Jobs are distributed automatically.
- **Session consistency**: Sessions are stored in Redis, so any API instance can serve any user.

---

## Tier 4: Kubernetes

Full orchestration with the Helm chart at `infra/helm/bigbluebam/`.

### Namespace Layout

```
bigbluebam-production/
  deployments/
    api (3 replicas, HPA)
    mcp-server (2 replicas, HPA)
    worker (2 replicas)
    frontend (2 replicas)

    api-service (ClusterIP)
    mcp-service (ClusterIP)
    frontend-service (ClusterIP)
  ingress/
    main-ingress (TLS termination)
  configmaps/
    app-config

    db-credentials
    redis-credentials
    s3-credentials
    session-secret
  hpa/
    api-hpa

```

### Helm Chart Installation

```bash
# Add required secrets
kubectl create namespace bigbluebam
kubectl -n bigbluebam create secret generic db-credentials \
  --from-literal=DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
kubectl -n bigbluebam create secret generic app-secrets \
  --from-literal=SESSION_SECRET="..." \
  --from-literal=REDIS_URL="..."

# Install
helm install bigbluebam infra/helm/bigbluebam/ \
  --namespace bigbluebam \
  --values infra/helm/bigbluebam/values-production.yaml
```

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

```yaml
# Example HPA for the API
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: api
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: memory
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 80
```

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### PostgreSQL Backups

| Method | Frequency | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| **Logical backup** (`pg_dump`) | Daily | 30 days |
| **Point-in-time recovery** (WAL archiving) | Continuous | 7 days |
| **Managed service snapshots** | Daily | Per provider policy |

```bash
# Manual backup
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U bigbluebam -Fc bigbluebam > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump

# Restore
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore -U bigbluebam -d bigbluebam < backup_20260402.dump
```

### Redis Backup

Redis uses AOF persistence. For managed services, use the provider's snapshot mechanism.

### MinIO / S3 Backup

Enable versioning on the S3 bucket. For MinIO, use `mc mirror` for cross-site replication:

```bash
mc mirror --watch minio/bigbluebam-attachments backup/bigbluebam-attachments
```

### Disaster Recovery Procedure

1. Provision new infrastructure (or restore from IaC)
2. Restore PostgreSQL from latest backup
3. Restore MinIO/S3 data
4. Update DNS to point to new infrastructure
5. Restart application containers
6. Verify health checks pass

### Pipeline Stages

| Trigger | Actions |
|---|---|
| **Every push** | Lint (ESLint + Biome), typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`), unit tests (Vitest) |
| **Pull request** | Above + ephemeral Docker Compose stack for integration tests |
| **Merge to main** | Build Docker images, push to GHCR, deploy to staging |
| **Tag (`v*`)** | Promote staging images to production with zero-downtime rolling update |

---

## Environment Matrix

| Environment | Purpose | Data | URL | Deploy Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Local dev** | Developer workstations | Local Docker volumes | `localhost` | Manual |
| **CI/test** | Automated testing | Ephemeral (destroyed after test) | N/A | Every push/PR |
| **Preview** | PR review with live app | Seeded test data | `pr-123.preview.bigbluebam.io` | PR creation |
| **Staging** | Pre-production validation | Anonymized production copy | `staging.bigbluebam.io` | Merge to main |
| **Production** | Live service | Real data | `app.bigbluebam.io` | Tagged release |

---

## Monitoring Stack

### Recommended Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Sentry** | Error tracking and performance monitoring | `@sentry/node` in API + `@sentry/react` in frontend |
| **Grafana** | Dashboards and visualization | Queries Prometheus and Loki |
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection | Scrapes `/metrics` endpoint on API |
| **Loki** | Log aggregation | Collects Docker container logs |

### Key Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| API response time (P95) | > 500ms | > 2s |
| API error rate | > 1% | > 5% |
| WebSocket connections | > 80% of limit | > 95% of limit |
| PostgreSQL connections | > 70% of pool | > 90% of pool |
| Redis memory usage | > 70% of max | > 90% of max |
| Worker queue depth | > 100 jobs | > 1000 jobs |
| Disk usage | > 70% | > 90% |

### Alerting

Configure alerts in Grafana or your cloud provider's monitoring service for the thresholds above. Critical alerts should page on-call. Warning alerts should notify a Slack channel.

---

## Health Check Endpoints

| Endpoint | Via nginx | Internal Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /b3/api/health` | Port 80 | 4000 (api) | Full health check (DB, Redis, MinIO connectivity) |
| `GET /mcp/health` | Port 80 | 3001 (mcp-server) | MCP server health + API connectivity |
| `GET /b3/api/health/live` | Port 80 | 4000 | Kubernetes liveness probe (is the process running?) |
| `GET /b3/api/health/ready` | Port 80 | 4000 | Kubernetes readiness probe (can it serve requests?) |

### Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime_seconds": 86400,
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "redis": "ok",
    "minio": "ok"
  }
}
```

If any check fails, the status becomes `"degraded"` and the HTTP status code changes to 503. This triggers container restarts (Docker health check) or pod replacement (Kubernetes readiness probe).
