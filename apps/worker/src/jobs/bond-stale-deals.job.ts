/**
 * Bond stale-deal sweep job — daily cron (Bond design doc §7).
 *
 * Finds open deals whose time-in-stage has exceeded `bond_pipeline_stages.rotting_days`
 * and which have not yet been alerted for the current stage entry, emits a
 * `bond.deal.rotting` event to Bolt for each one, and marks the deal with
 * `rotting_alerted_at = NOW()` so the same stage-entry is not re-alerted.
 *
 * Idempotency model:
 *   - A deal is considered newly stale if either
 *       rotting_alerted_at IS NULL, or
 *       rotting_alerted_at < stage_entered_at.
 *     The second clause naturally resets every time a deal moves stage, because
 *     the stage-change path on bond-api bumps stage_entered_at.
 *
 * Ordering decision (update-AFTER-emission):
 *   We emit the event first, THEN update rotting_alerted_at. A crash between
 *   those two steps will cause the SAME deal to retry on the next daily run —
 *   that is the intended behavior, since bolt-api might genuinely have been
 *   down. The trade-off is that a successful POST followed by a crash before
 *   the UPDATE produces one duplicate alert on the next run; duplicates are
 *   preferable to silent drops for rotting deals. `publishBoltEvent` is
 *   fire-and-forget, so a single bad event never blocks the rest of the batch
 *   and never throws out of the loop.
 *
 * Runs at 02:00 UTC (offset from beacon-expiry-sweep @ 03:00 and bearing-snapshot @ 00:00).
